# DS-Capstone
###This is a simple frequency based approach for the Data Science Capstone problem (John Hopkins Data Science Specilization Coursera) 

## What was the DS Capstone problem ?
### It was basically a NLP project where the problem was to identify (or guess) the next word based on the word entered by the user.
### For example if the user entered the word Happy the system should guess the next pairing word with happy in this case Birthday.

## What was my approach to solve the problem ?
### I first visualized the most frequent n-grams (both keeping and ignoring stopwords) and then decided to go with the most simple approach.
### My apporach simply returns the most frequent pair word after getting the user input. It is not a reliable method but it gives fascinating resutls.
### It performed very well with common words, even identified names (For example input : Barack output : Obama) 

## Is the solution reliable enough ? 
### No, there are far more advanced methods and models this is not even close. I went with it as I was very new to the field and I did what was 
### possible for me at the moment.
